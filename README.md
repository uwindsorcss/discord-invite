# UWindsor Computer Science Society Discord Server

This page used to contain information about the Discord server while our domain was down, but now it's just a redirect to the actual site.

<!-- Instructions on how to join the UWindsor CSS Discord server

## How to Join

To join our server, you'll first need to go to [this site](https://dca1-137-207-224-61.ngrok.io/discord). From there, you'll need to sign in with your UWindsor account as well as your Discord account. After that, you'll automatically be added to the server!

## FAQ

### Why can't you just use a Discord invite?

Our server is strictly UWindsor students only. To achieve this, we've created a custom system that verifies you based on your UWindsor email. If your email corresponds to a staff member, you won't be allowed to access the server. We believe in guaranteeing a safe place for students to converse with 0 fear of oversight from professors or university staff.

### How do I know this site is safe for me to log into?

We use Oauth for authorizing users, which essentially means we don't actually ever see your UWindsor or Discord password. All we get access to is the ability to view your name and email address. On the Discord side, all we get access to is the ability to add your account to our server.

If you'd like to see how this is accomplished, our system is completely open source and viewable [here](https://github.com/uwindsorcss/hub).

### Why is the domain weird, and why am I seeing [a message like this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937419611622752277/1014634585155436614/unknown.png)

Normally, to be added to our server you would access our website via https://css.uwindsor.ca/discord. However, due to a recent cybersecurity incident with the university, all university websites were brought offline. While some sites are back up, ours is not yet. As a result, we have opted to use a service called [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get our website temporarily online via a different domain. This is a temporary solution that we're hoping will no longer be necessary soon.
